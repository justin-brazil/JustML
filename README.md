# JustML

JustML is a custom markup language designed by Justin Brazil that allows text-based data to be filtered, sorted, cataloged, and parsed programattically.

A PowerShell scripting standardization framework that prorivdes consistent handling and storage of scripts, logs, output, and parsable text-based data.  Implementation of these standards in all scripts allows you to handle all of these items with absolute consistency, and provides a markup laguage that enables your files to be indexed, cataloged, and sorted with a high degree of precision.
